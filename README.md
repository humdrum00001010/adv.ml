# Advanced ML Project

This repository contains code, scripts, and resources for an advanced machine learning project focused on [brief description, e.g., deepfake detection or image manipulation analysis]. It uses datasets like FaceForensics++ (excluded here for size; see setup instructions below).

## Setup
1. Clone this repo.
2. Install dependencies (e.g., via `pip install -r requirements.txt` if added).
3. Download external data (e.g., FaceForensics++ from official source: https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics) and place in `data/`.
4. Run scripts from the `scripts/` folder.

## Folders
- `adv/`: [Your subproject, e.g., core ML code].
- `demo/` and `demo_median/`: Example runs and outputs.
- `external/`: Other tools (FaceForensics excluded).
- `papers/`: Relevant research papers.
- `scripts/`: Training and evaluation scripts.

## Notes
- Virtual env in `env/` (ignored in Git).
- Models and logs are generated during training (ignored).
- For Kaggle data, add your `kaggle.json` locally.
